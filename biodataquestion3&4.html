    Writing about yourself is one of the easy tasks. Everyone is different, and when you write about yourself, you are showing your uniqueness. 
    Its one of the ways you can put forth the things you know about yourself. When you start writing, you can start with a small introduction about who you are and what you do. 
    Then, you can continue writing about your hobbies and talents. Some people prefer to write about how they acquired some of the hobbies that they possess.
